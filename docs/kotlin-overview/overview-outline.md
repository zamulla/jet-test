# Outline for the main document of the overview section

This is the outline for The Overview page that was mentioned in the [high-level description](./overview.md) of the section rework.

The title of the page is “Language overview”.

## Intro

* Intro paragraphs: the “Kotlin is a programming language which...” paragraph, facts and goals in the broadest terms. I'd cut and paste the first paragraph from the [Get started](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/getting-started.html) page, maybe expanding on it.
  * (Aside: the Get started page could use something more specific as an intro, which would lead into the specific cases later on. Also, it's kind of weird to send the reader off to take a tour of the language without letting him get started. I would make the send-off softer, without the huge banner, and with a better reason than “why not”, because putting the *fun* in *fun*damentals can be a little clearer.)
* Advantages: the list of universal advantages of Kotlin as a language: mature, boilerplate-free, Java-compatible, etc.

## Kotlin is useful for any project

The list of use cases that was compiled earlier: mobile, web, server, data science, competitive programming, with links to the corresponding pages.

## Kotlin has a robust standard library

A paragraph on the standard library standout features — collections, scope functions etc. — with a link to the standard library overview. Then a paragraph on the official libraries, with a simple list and a link for further reading.

## Kotlin is interoperable with Java
Concisely presenting the comparison to Java and ease of calling the code back and forth, with links to the corresponding pages for details.

## Kotlin runs without a virtual machine

Explanation of Kotlin/Native and mention of Multiplatform, with links for further reading.

## Kotlin is easy to learn
Here we can tout the amount and variety of educational material and link to [Learning materials](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/learning-materials-overview.html).

At the very end, if the reader didn't follow any links and just reached the bottom of the page, — that's where I'd put the “Start Kotlin tour” banner that I suggested removing from “Get started”.
