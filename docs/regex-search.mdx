# Regex how-to

Regular expressions are a powerful tool for search and replace text manipulations. Kotlin standard library provides classes for implementing your regular expressions logic, and this guide provides some basic usage examples for these classes.

We'll assume that you are familiar with regular expression syntax in general. The guide only covers Kotlin implementation specifically.

## Setup

Let's declare a string that we're going to be operating on in the course of this guide:

```kotlin
val input = "Hello, world, hello."
```

Then let's create a couple of patterns, one using the `RegEx` constructor and another using the `String.toRegex` method:

```kotlin
val patternWorld = "world".toRegex()

// The second pattern uses the case-insensitive option to match words with capital letters as well.
// For all available options see https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.text/-regex-option/
val patternHello = Regex("hello", setOf(RegexOption.IGNORE_CASE))
```

Now you're ready to get matching.

## Is there a match?

The simplest problem is to find out whether the provided input matches a pattern at all. The `containsMatchIn` method returns a boolean value:

```kotlin
println("Is there a match for \"$patternHello\" in the string \"$input\"?")
if (patternHello.containsMatchIn(input)) println("Yes!") else println("Nope.")
```

The result is:

```text
Is there a match for "hello" in the string "Hello, world, hello."?
Yes!
```

## Find a match

To find matches one by one, use the `Regex.find()` method. The result is an object of the `MatchResult` class, which we'll store in the `match` variable. It has a `value` and a `range` — the matched string fragment and the position of this fragment within the input string:

```kotlin
var match = patternHello.find(input)
if (match?.value?.isNotEmpty() == true) {
    println("Found a match: \"${match.value}\" at the position ${match.range}")
}
else {
    println("No matches here.")
}
```

The `MatchResult` class also has the `next()` method which allows you to get the next match for the same string/pattern pair:

```kotlin
match = match?.next()
```

If you print out the results for both old and new values of the variable, you'll see this in the console:

```text
Found a match: "Hello" at the position 0..4
Found a match: "hello" at the position 14..18
```

## Find all matches

To get all matches found within the text, use the `Regex.findAll()` method. It returns a sequence of `MatchResult` objects:

```kotlin
val matches = patternHello.findAll(input)

println("All matches found:")
for ((index, result) in matches.withIndex()) {
    println("${index+1}. \"${result.value}\" at the position ${result.range}")
}
```

Printed out results:

```text
All matches found:
1. "Hello" at the position 0..4
2. "hello" at the position 14..18
```



## Find groups

Regular expressions are often written using groups — identifiable sections of a pattern. With Kotlin, you can find individual groups within the matches:

```kotlin
val patternWord = Regex("(\\wello), (\\world)")

val matchGroups = patternWord.find(input)

// We're looking for the group[1] value since group[0] always corresponds to the entire matched string.
println("The first group found: ${matchGroups!!.groups[1]?.value}")
```

Since Kotlin 1.9.0 you can also define named groups and retrieve them without juggling the index:

```
val patternWord = Regex("(?<hi>\\wello), (?<who>\\world)")

val matchGroups = patternWord.find(input)

println("The first 'who' group: ${matchGroups!!.groups["who"]?.value}")
println("The first 'hi' group: ${matchGroups.groups["hi"]?.value}")
```

## ...and more!

The `Regex` class also provides methods:

* for replacing found matches and splitting the input string around them,
* for more specific search within the string,
* for converting the created pattern to an object of the Java `Pattern` class.

Try it out — the exhaustive description of the class, as always, is available in the [standard library reference](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.text/-regex/). Let us know if it's everything you dreamed of in that weird nightmare you had about regular expressions.
